# wsearch
Simple JS function to find closest values in objects.
## Installation

```
## Basic usage
First argument: RegExp to search in values. Second: any object supporting for ... in loop iterates.
```js
wsearch(/Hello\sworld/, window);
```
Output:
```
[
	[*string path to value*, *array of matches*]
	...
]
```
## Info

Ð¡lone the object to prevent this before searching.
## Customizing
You can add custom options to searching in third argument of function. For example:
```js
wsearch(/Hello\sworld/, window, {functions: true});
```
List of options:
- `functions`: true OR false (default)
> Add functions body to search.
- `typesAdd`: array of string (default: `["Window", "Object", "Array", "Set", "Map"]`)
> Add custom types to defaults (like "Location", "Navigator" etc.). You can get type of any object:
```js
Object.prototype.toString.call(object);
```
- `typesSet`: array of string OR "all"
> Replace defaults types with custom.
>
>***WARNING!*** Use value "all" very carefully. With this parameter search will be performed in all prototypes that are found and will take a very long time.
>
>Most of the time this option value is not needed.
- `varName`: string (default: `"wsearchWasHere"`)
> The property name to be added to the objects in search.
## Output
If path to value includes Map object, property of this object transform to string. If the properties match, at the end of the property name adding hash and unique number: `#(n > 0)`
